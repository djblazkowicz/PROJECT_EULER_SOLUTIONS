this repo is my personal solutions to https://projecteuler.net coding challenges

all solutions are written in the C programming language

the solutions measure time and use a small framework so we can run different inputs than specified in the challenges

all solutions are using the template from the template folder

each challenge's source files are in a separate folder, folder names follow a 4 digit rolling number convention

running next-challenge.ps1 powershell script will create a new folder with the next rolling number available and deploy the template source files

the description of the challenge is automatically downloaded and added to the source .c file as comments.
